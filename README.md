# FitnessApp

## Project Description

This is a fitness app called "PowerFitness". PowerFitness is a mobile fitness application built with React Native, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The app allows users to track their workouts and fitness progress, set goals, and access workout plans.

### Features

1. Create and track workout routines
2. Log exercises and set progress goals
3. Access pre-made workout plans
4. View progress and analytics
5. Track burned calories, number of completed workouts & total workout time.

### Technologies Used

1. React Native
2. Expo

## MVC Architecture

PowerFitness follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This architectural pattern separates an application into three main components:

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. In PowerFitness, the Model includes the data models for users, workouts, exercises, and progress logs.

View: Represents the user interface of the application. In PowerFitness, the View includes the React Native components and screens that the user interacts with.

Controller: Handles the interaction between the Model and the View. In PowerFitness, the Controller includes the logic for handling user input, retrieving data from the Model, and updating the View.

By separating these components, the MVC architecture makes it easier to maintain and modify an application over time.
