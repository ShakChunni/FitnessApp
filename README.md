## MVC Architecture

PowerFitness follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This architectural pattern separates an application into three main components:

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. In PowerFitness, the Model includes the data models for users, workouts, exercises, and progress logs.

View: Represents the user interface of the application. In PowerFitness, the View includes the React Native components and screens that the user interacts with.

Controller: Handles the interaction between the Model and the View. In PowerFitness, the Controller includes the logic for handling user input, retrieving data from the Model, and updating the View.

By separating these components, the MVC architecture makes it easier to maintain and modify an application over time.
